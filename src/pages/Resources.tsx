      question: "What is regenerative medicine and how does it work?",
      answer: "Regenerative medicine harnesses your body's natural healing mechanisms to repair damaged tissues and organs. Our advanced cellular therapies use stem cells and exosomes to promote tissue regeneration, reduce inflammation, and support the body's natural recovery processes."
    },
    {
      question: "Are stem cell treatments safe?",
      answer: "Yes, our stem cell treatments are rigorously tested and meet the highest safety standards. All our cellular products are sourced from FDA-registered laboratories and undergo extensive quality control testing. Our medical professionals carefully evaluate each patient to ensure treatment safety and efficacy."
    },
    {
      question: "What conditions can be treated with regenerative therapy?",
      answer: "Our regenerative therapies have shown effectiveness in treating various conditions including arthritis, sports injuries, chronic pain, autoimmune conditions, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular issues. Each treatment plan is personalized based on your specific condition and health profile."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results?",
      answer: "Results vary depending on the condition being treated and individual patient factors. Some patients notice improvements within weeks, while others may see gradual progress over several months. Our medical team will discuss realistic timelines during your consultation."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between MSC, CBSC, and Exosomal therapies?",
      answer: "MSCs (Mesenchymal Stem Cells) are multipotent cells that can differentiate into various tissue types. CBSC (Cord Blood Stem Cells) are harvested from umbilical cord blood and offer high potency. Exosomal therapy uses cellular communication vesicles that promote healing without using actual cells."
    },
    {
      question: "Is treatment covered by insurance?",
      answer: "Coverage varies by insurance provider and specific treatment. Many regenerative therapies are considered investigational and may not be covered. We recommend contacting your insurance provider to discuss coverage options. Our team can provide necessary documentation for insurance inquiries."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I prepare for my treatment?",
      answer: "Preparation varies by treatment type. Generally, patients should stay hydrated, avoid anti-inflammatory medications for a specified period, and follow any specific pre-treatment instructions provided by our medical team. Detailed preparation guidelines will be provided during your consultation."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes BioCellRx different from other providers?",
      answer: "BioCellRx stands out through our 20+ years of research experience, partnerships with leading laboratories, comprehensive medical network, and commitment to using only the highest quality cellular products. We provide personalized treatment plans and ongoing support throughout your healing journey."
